first i forced user to sign in then let him to use this app,for signup and login process i used back4app parse server
i used back4app as a parse server for inserting and retrieving info from server,
from a list of users who are signed in to this app a specific user can follow or unfollow the respected user 
and further the current user will get to see the posts of only the users who he follows.
there are multiple activities for multiple purpose and according users behavior the user moves from one activity to the other.
